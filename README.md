## Biography

Hello there, my name is Jacob Patel. In the late summer of 2017 I decided to sharpen my Swift skills by creating a small game known as FlyRight. This project quickly expanded and before I knew it, the once simple single-view application became a complex multi-view game. This game represents my struggle to venture into the unknown around me, the dark looming space, to fly the right path to success. (SAY WHAT PLATFORM)
